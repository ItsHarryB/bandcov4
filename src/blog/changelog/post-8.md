For the version of this website to change from v0.2.0 to 0.3.0 on 02/10/2025, some changes were made to the formatting, appearance and layout of this website - mainly to the links page.
Examples of such changes is the implementation of social media and other links (Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Bluesky and GitHub, Vinted and eBay). There have also been behind-the-scenes tweaks as well.

For v0.3.1-0.3.3, some more minor formatting changes were made to the overall website - largely in the form of implementing a "sticky" header on both desktop and mobile versions of the site..
